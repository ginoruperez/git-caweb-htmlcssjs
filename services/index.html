                    <strong> PADI Open Water Scuba Diver </strong>
                    This program is for the individual who is seeking Scuba certification. The course is approximately
                    30 hours of private or semi-private Scuba instruction. Private instruction enables our instructors
                    to provide a safe and comfortable diving experience that meets your individual needs. This is a
                    complete Scuba course that combines instruction in basic watermanship skills, diving theory, and
                    practical diving experience. The emphasis will be on making you a safe, self-sufficient, and
                    self-reliant diver. Certification cards will be issued upon completion. This course includes at
                    least 5 classroom sessions, 5 pool sessions, and 5 ocean dives. All equipment will be provided for

                    If it’s been a while since your were last out in the ocean, then it would be a good idea to do a
                    skills update. A certified Divemaster or Instructor will spend time with you answering any questions
                    and also working with you in the pool to make sure all open water skills are up to date.

                    What every diver should know before they purchase any scuba equipment will be covered in this
                    program. If you ever have experienced equipment problems in the water or have not felt totally
                    comfortable on a dive, then this program is for you. The emphasis of this course is on local diving
                    including proper thermal protection, weighting, and air control. These subjects are all covered in
                    greater depth than your open water scuba class. The diving theory far exceeds other programs used
                    for advanced diver certification. This program is specifically designed to teach divers the proper
                    use of the different styles of scuba equipment — Jacket vs. Back Buoyancy, Integrated vs.
                    Conventional Weight Systems, Steel vs. Aluminum Tanks, Vented vs. Paddle Fins, and Wet vs. Dry
                    Suits. This course includes 15 hours of classroom and pool training. We will supply all of the
                    equipment necessary for the course.

                    <strong>Rescue Diving</strong>
                    This course will teach the certified diver how to handle minor emergency situations. The student is
                    taught Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) as well as how to be a first responder when an accident
                    occurs. The treatment for the majority of water accidents is the delivery of 100% pure oxygen to the
                    victim. This course will teach the student the correct way to handle and deliver 100% pure oxygen to
                    someone in need.
